# Tetris Rush - JavaScript Edition

This project is a simple implementation of the classic game Tetris, built using JavaScript. The game is designed to run in the browser and uses basic web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into three main files:

- `index.html`: This is the main HTML file that contains the structure of the game. It includes a game area, a level indicator, and a start button.

- `style.css`: This file contains all the CSS styles used in the game. It defines the look and feel of the game, including the game area, the Tetris blocks, and the start button.

- `main.js`: This is the main JavaScript file that contains the game logic. It handles the creation of Tetris blocks, the game loop, and the game rules (like collision detection and line clearing).

## How to Run

To run the game, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
